## Description
Live Link: (https://gavpo.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

This application was made to help people that are travelling by showing the current weather, as well as the weather forecast for the next week for the city of their coice. I learned a lot about using data from an API and making dynamic elements for each item in the API.

## Usage
Use this application to search a city and get it's current weather and weekly forecast. Just type into the search field and press the search button to get that cities weather. Searched cities will be saved under the search field, just press on the name of a city to see that cities forecast again.
